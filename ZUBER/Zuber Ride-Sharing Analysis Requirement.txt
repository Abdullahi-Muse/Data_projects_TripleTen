Project: Zuber Ride-Sharing Analysis
Project Goal:
To analyze ride-sharing data to identify patterns in passenger behavior and the impact of external factors, specifically weather conditions, on ride frequency and duration.
Data Analysis Tasks:
Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
   * Handle missing values and outliers.
   * Convert data types as needed (e.g., date/time formats).
   * Create relevant features (e.g., day of week, time of day, weather conditions).
2. Univariate Analysis:
   * Analyze the distribution of numerical variables (e.g., ride duration, distance).
   * Analyze the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., ride type, pickup location, drop-off location).
3. Bivariate Analysis:
   * Analyze the relationship between pairs of variables (e.g., ride duration and distance, ride frequency and weather conditions).
   * Visualize relationships using scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts.
Step 2: Impact of Weather on Ride Duration (Loop to O'Hare)
1. Data Filtering:
   * Filter data for rides originating from the Loop and terminating at O'Hare International Airport.
   * Filter data for rainy Saturdays and other days/weather conditions.
2. Hypothesis Testing:
   * Formulate a null hypothesis (e.g., there is no significant difference in ride duration between rainy Saturdays and other days).
   * Conduct a statistical test (e.g., t-test or ANOVA) to compare the mean ride duration between groups.
3. Data Visualization:
   * Create box plots to visualize the distribution of ride durations for different groups.
   * Create line plots to visualize trends in ride duration over time for different weather conditions.
By completing this project, we aim to gain valuable insights into passenger behavior and the impact of weather conditions on ride-sharing services. These insights can inform strategic decisions, such as dynamic pricing, fleet optimization, and marketing campaigns.
